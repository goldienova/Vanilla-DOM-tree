# Vanilla-DOM-tree

**Project Goal**

To run project locally:

* From terminal, 'npm install http-server -g'
* In project folder, in terminal enter command 'http-server'

To run tests:

* 'npm install' for project dependencies
* Run 'npm test' in terminal

**Project Goal**

My goal in this project is to create a browser visualization of a data tree strucutre.  I hope to eventually turn this into a problem-solving map where users can map out problem-solving work flows.


**Map Rules**

*By imposing a series of simple rules, I hope to retain some type of logical order*

* Each node can have multiple child nodes

* Each node can have multiple parent nodes

* No node can have a "sibling" node--or be connected in any way other than through child or parent connections


**Next Steps**

* Fix Known Bugs
  * Fix Dynamic Spacing for Multiple Shared Children

* Add Tests

* Add User Interface so that Users have the ability to:
  * Add or Delete Child Nodes
  * Add or Delete Parent Nodes

* Add Database for persistant data

* Add state machine for local state
