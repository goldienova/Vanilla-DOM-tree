# Vanilla-DOM-tree


**Project Goal**

My goal in this project is to create a browser visualization of a data tree strucutre.  I hope to eventually turn this into a problem-solving map where users can map out problem-solving work flows.


**Map Rules**

*By imposing a series of simple rules, I hope to retain some type of logical order*

* Each node can have multiple child nodes

* Each node can have multiple parent nodes

* No node can have a "sibling" node--or be connected in any way other than through child or parent connections


**Next Steps**

* Add additional visual cues to map including:
   * More intuitive and dynamic spacing between children nodes when there are shared child nodes
   * Add lines that are dynamically drawn between children and parent nodes to better represent tree connections
